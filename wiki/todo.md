### Decibel should support Windows and Linux
>Support for Android, Mac and iOS would also be nice (in that order). Mac support should be fairly easy.

---
### Decibel should allow for Voice and Text communication
>Only UDP packets will be used as they are better suited for data streaming introducing one protocol can induce packet loss in the other.

---
### Decibel should allow for different volumes to be set for different users
>This should be possible client side and (to be used in rare cases) server side

---
### Decibel should offer Server, Channel and Private text modes
>All three modes should act the same way. Private is between 2 people only.

>Voice should be limited to channel mode only

---
### Decibel should support a peer-to-peer mode
>This can be used by idiots that do not have servers, and is designed for voice chat between 2 individuals but it should support more. Whoever starts the call will effectively host a single channel server which shuts down once the call is over.
>>-> What about peer-to-peer text chat with more than 2 people?

---
### Usernames should be managed somehow
> We could use first-come-first-served for now

> A registering system like Mumble's could work after that

> A user server with email addresses would be best

> Avatars

---
### Channels should support Normal, Text and Voice modes
> Normal should be default as it makes most sense

---
### Chat should support external videos (e.g. YT) or short file based ones (e.g. MP4)
> Same with images

> No playing videos/GIFs by default

---
### Screen sharing and easy screenshots would be nice

>Automatically dump screenshots in current chat

---
### BOT support

>Custom commands e.g. !help would print useful information to users

---
### Server side emojis

---
### Channel avatars and descriptions

---
### User bio and comments

---
### Sound effects for some elements of the interface

---
### Custom themes and sounds

---
### Text-To-Speech

>Use pre-made voice packs to customize Text-To-Speech

---
### Custom key bindings

>Allow users to bind simple functions (Mute self, Deafen self, etc.) to different keys that suit them

---
### Optional automatic mic gain adjustment
